# CFFStrings #

----------

CFFStrings is a simple extension to CFF Explorer ( [http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php](http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php) ) by Daniel Pistelli. This extension can parse all ASCII and Unicode strings from any file and optionally save them to disk.

## Usage ##

When you launch CFF Explorer, a new 'Strings' item will be displayed. You can quickly view strings of any length (min 3) by simple hitting the 'Find Strings' button.
