# CFFCapstone #

----------

CFFCapstone is a simple extension to CFF Explorer ( [http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php](http://www.ntcore.com/exsuite.php) ) by Daniel Pistelli. This extension provides Capstone ( [http://www.capstone-engine.org/](http://www.capstone-engine.org/) ) disassembly support on any area of the file. Currently only Intel x86/x64 disassembly is supported.

## Usage ##

When you launch CFF Explorer, a new 'Capstone' item will be displayed. You can quickly disassemble any area of the file buy providing the file offset and disassembly length (both values should be specified in hex)
